Introduction

	The information herein refers to parser version 4.1. 

	The program is used to parse C/C++ programs and may be instrumented to
	provide additional output for projects based on the analysis of source code
	in C/C++ such as for "pretty printing", complexity analysis, and generally 
	for any program understanding requirement.

	The parser is generated from a language definition file called CPP_parser_.g
	using the open source ANTLR parser generation system obtainable from 
	http://www.antlr2.org . ANTLR version used is 3.2. 


1.  How to run the parser

	This description is for the use of Java in an MSDOS window for parser 
	generation and Visual Studio 2008 for compiling and running the parser and 
	analysis programs.

	This is because ANTLR is written in Java but we optionally request the parser
	to be written in C++ so as to be able to include data extraction modules
	previously written in C.

	See the next section on how to organise your files to be able to run the 
	system as described below.

1a. Generate the parser

	Download the ANTLR 3.2 Java archive from http://www.antlr.org/download.  
	Edit compile.bat and set ANTLR3HOME and CLASSPATH accordingly.

	A log of the resulting output is included with this archive at 
	Reference\4.1\grammar4.1.0antlr3.2.txt. 


1b. Compile and build the parser

	Open antlr3_cpp_parser.sln with Visual Studio 2008.
	From the menu run Build => Build Solution. 
	The result is a file named antlr3_cpp_parser.exe. 


1c. Run the parser

	Open an MSDOS command window. Enter the following command to parse 
	a pre-processed file (*.i) in the TestIfiles\ directory as follows:

		.../MyProject>debug\antlr3_cpp_parser.exe TestIfiles\Quadratic.i

	To place the DOS output in another file for later examination use,

		.../MyProject>debug\antlr3_cpp_parser TestIfiles\Quadratic.i > Quadratic.trace


	This run should normally produce something like this,


		Parse TestIfiles\Quadratic.i Wed Dec 12 13:26:03 2010
		...
		Support exitExternalScope, scope now 0 as required


    
	If scope does not end as 0 a slightly different warning will be produced. 
	This could occur if there is some error in the parsing process in which
	case some other error warning(s) should also have been displayed by the 
	parser.
		
	The files Quadratic.dat, Quadratic.lis and Quadratic.log are "optional" 
	files produced by version 3.2 and included for reference.  See the next 
	section for details. 




2. How to extract data with the parser

   One of the main reasons for processing source code with the ANTLR parser
   is to extract specific data from program source code for processing by a 
   user's (ie. your) program.

   To do this the user needs to: 
      - to include in the Visual Studio project the MyCode.cpp and MyCode.hpp
        found under Reference\3.2 
      - adapt these files
      - include action statements in the parser definition, CPP_parser_.g 
        as follows below.



2a.	In order to adapt the use of MyCode examine the following

	Find in CPP_parser_.g

	// myCode functions ready for overriding in MyCode subclass
	// Include application code functions here
	virtual void myCode_pre_processing(int, char *[]);
	virtual void myCode_post_processing();
	virtual void myCode_end_of_stmt();
	virtual void myCode_function_direct_declarator(const char *);

	and

		{		
#ifdef MYCODE
		if (definition)
			myCode_function_direct_declarator(q);
#endif MYCODE
		}

	and in Support.cpp

	//	Functions which may be overridden by MyCode subclass

	void CPPParser::
	myCode_pre_processing(int argc,char *argv[])
		{
		}

2b. This is what they are for,

    myCode_pre_processing(int, char *[]) is defined in MyCode.cpp and
	initialises the user's (ie. your) MyCode application.

    myCode_post_processing() is defined in MyCode.cpp and finalises and
	closes down the user's application.

	myCode_end_of_stmt() is defined in MyCode.cpp and is used to clear 
	any unwanted settings at the end of processing each statement.

    myCode_function_direct_declarator(const char *) is defined in MyCode.cpp
	and is an example of how data can be extracted from the ANTLR parser. By 
	placing the statement "if (definition) myCode_function_direct_declarator(q);"
	within the #ifdef/#endif in the production function_direct_declarator in 
	CPP_parser.g the required data (in this case represented by the variable 
	"q") is extracted and can be processed or stored appropriately by the user.

2c. The user (ie. yourself) can take over the use of MyCode.cpp and introduce 
    whatever functions are required in the same way as shown above to extract 
	whatever data is required from (pre-processed) C++ source code.
