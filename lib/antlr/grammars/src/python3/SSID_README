This file illustrates how to modify / rebuild this grammar. Not all steps
need to be followed. Please read the description of each step and decide
accordingly (for example, you may not need to redownload the grammar file)

Note that the current grammar does not count whitespaces so the resulting
csv will have erroneous values for the position information (column 2). We
can either change the grammar file or post-process the token information by
keeping a whitespace count to add to each token position info.

Obtaining the Grammar file
==========================

1. The contents of this directory were retrieved from the publicly available
   list of ANTLR grammars at http://www.antlr.org/grammar/list. In
   particular, it corresponds to the "Python 3 grammar for C target"
   by Ales Teska, listed with a date of Oct 9, 2009 at 
   https://devel.exidius.com/files/python3grammarC.tar.gz

2. Untar the file

3. If you untar the file from Step 1, the extracted files will consist
   of four files and a directory "python3grammar" of the same four files. As
   such, you can go ahead and delete the directory.

Compiling the grammar
=====================

4. Assuming your antlr library is at
   SSID/lib/java/jar/antlr-3.4-complete.jar, then you compile the grammar
   file "python3.g" with:

   java -jar SSID/lib/java/jar/antlr-3.4-complete.jar python3.g

   This will produce 5 files: python3Lexer.c, python3Lexer.h,
   python3Parser.c, python3Parser.h and python3.tokens

Modifying the lexer and parser codes
====================================

5. Some of the source files assume a different path for the python3Lexer.h
   and python3Parser.h header files, so you will need to modify the files
   python3lexerutils.c and test_cpython3.c

6. Modify the test_cpython3.c file as you see fit. See the currently modified
   version of this file for details on what kind of output is expected by
   SSID's PlagiarismDetection.jar of the resulting binary
   
7. Compile the codes: gcc -o test_cpython3 *.c -I/usr/local/include/ -L/usr/local/lib -lantlr3c

8. Copy the binary to the assumed location and name for the lexer

   cp test_cpython3 SSID/lib/antlr/grammars/bin/python3/python3_lexer

9. Copy the token file to the assumed location and name

   cp python3.tokens SSID/lib/antlr/grammars/bin/python3/python3_tokens

Modifying the token mappings for SSID
=====================================

10. If you make any changes to the python3_tokens file, you may need to
    change how the token names are mapped to SSID token types (either
    Variable, Symbol, Keyword, Constant, or Ignore). See
    SSID/lib/antlr/README for details. The resulting mapping file should
    be saved as SSID/lib/antlr/grammars/bin/python3/python3_token_mappings
